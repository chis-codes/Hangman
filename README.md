# Hangman
Simple command-line hangman match written in Python

Run: python3 game.py

Run the game in the command line and you will receive a random secret word.  Guess a letter
at a time and the entire word when you're ready, but be careful as your hangman will fill up
and you could lose the game with too many guesses.
